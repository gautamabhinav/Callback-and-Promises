<!-- If an error occurs during the Fetch request, the script catches the error and logs an error message to the console. It also creates a new p element on the webpage and appends it to the body element, displaying an error message to the user. -->



<!-- When a successful response is received from the server, the then() method is called with a Response object as its argument. We can then use the methods of this object to extract the response data and perform further actions with it.

In this case, the then() method is used to parse the JSON data from the response using the json() method. The resulting data is passed to the callback function as an argument, which logs it to the console using console.log(). -->
