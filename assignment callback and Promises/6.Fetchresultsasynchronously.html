<!-- his function, we first use the fetch() function to make an HTTP request to the specified URL. This function returns a Promise object that resolves with the Response object representing the response from the server.

We then use the json() method on the Response object to parse the response body as JSON and return a Promise that resolves with the resulting JavaScript object.

Finally, we log the resulting object to the console using console.log().

Note that we wrap the entire function body in a try...catch block to handle any errors that might occur during the HTTP request or JSON parsing. -->
